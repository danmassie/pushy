# pushy

Pushy is a Java library for sending [APNs](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Introduction.html) (iOS and OS X) push notifications. It is written and maintained by the engineers at [RelayRides](https://relayrides.com/) and is built on the [Netty framework](http://netty.io/).

Pushy was created because we found that the other APNs libraries for Java simply didn't meet our needs in terms of reliability or performance. Pushy distinguishes itself from other libraries with several important features:

- Asynchronous network IO (via Netty) for maximum performance
- Efficient connection management (other libraries appear to reconnect to the APNs gateway far more frequently than is really necessary)
- Graceful handling and reporting of permanent notification rejections
- Thorough [documentation](http://relayrides.github.io/pushy/apidocs/0.1/)

We believe that Pushy is already the best tool for sending APNs push notifications from Java applications, and we hope you'll help us make it even better via bug reports and pull requests. Thanks!

## Getting Pushy

If you use [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), you can add Pushy to your project by adding the following dependency declaration to your POM:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.relayrides</groupId>
    <artifactId>pushy</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

If you don't use Maven, you can [download Pushy as a `.jar` file](https://github.com/relayrides/pushy/releases/download/pushy-0.1.1/pushy-0.1.1.jar) and add it to your project directly. You'll also need to make sure you have Pushy's runtime dependencies on your classpath. They are:

- [netty 4.0.7.Final](http://netty.io/)
- [slf4j 1.7.2](http://www.slf4j.org/)
- [json.simple 1.1.1](https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/)

## Using Pushy

The main public-facing part of Pushy is the [`PushManager`](http://relayrides.github.io/pushy/apidocs/0.1/com/relayrides/pushy/apns/PushManager.html) class, which manages connections to APNs and manages the queue of outbound notifications. Before you can create a `PushManager`, though, you'll need appropriate SSL certificates and keys from Apple. They can be obtained by following the steps in Apple's ["Provisioning and Development"](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/ProvisioningDevelopment.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH104-SW1) guide.

Once you have your certificates and keys, you can construct a new `PushManager` like this:

```java
final String keystorePassword = "mySecretPassword";
final FileInputStream keystoreInputStream = new FileInputStream("/path/to/certificate.p12");

try {
    final KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance("PKCS12");
    keyStore.load(keystoreInputStream, keystorePassword.toCharArray());

    final PushManager<SimpleApnsPushNotification> pushManager =
        new PushManager<SimpleApnsPushNotification>(
            ApnsEnvironment.getSandboxEnvironment(), keyStore, keystorePassword);
    
    pushManager.start();
} finally {
    keystoreInputStream.close();
}
```

Once you have your `PushManager` constructed and started, you're ready to start constructing and sending push notifications. Pushy provides a number of utility classes for working with APNs tokens and payloads. Here's an example:

```java
final byte[] token = TokenUtil.tokenStringToByteArray(
    "<5f6aa01d 8e335894 9b7c25d4 61bb78ad 740f4707 462c7eaf bebcf74f a5ddb387>");

final ApnsPayloadBuilder payloadBuilder = new ApnsPayloadBuilder();

payloadBuilder.setAlertBody("Ring ring, Neo.");
payloadBuilder.setSoundFileName("ring-ring.aiff");

final String payload = payloadBuilder.buildWithDefaultMaximumLength();

pushManager.enqueuePushNotification(
		new SimpleApnsPushNotification(token, payload));
```

When your application shuts down, make sure to shut down the `PushManager`, too:

```java
List<SimpleApnsPushNotification> unsentNotifications = pushManager.shutdown();
```

Note that there's no guarantee as to when a push notification will be sent after it's enqueued. Shutting down the `PushManager` returns a list of notifications still in the outbound queue so you'll know what hasn't been transmitted to APNs.

## Error handling

Push notification providers communicate with APNs by opening a long-lived connection to Apple's push notification gateway and streaming push notification through that connection. Apple's gateway won't respond or acknowledge push notifications unless something goes wrong, in which case it will send an error code and close the connection (don't worry -- Pushy deals with all of this for you). To deal with notifications that are rejected by APNs, Pushy provides a notion of a [`RejectedNotificationListener`](http://relayrides.github.io/pushy/apidocs/0.1/com/relayrides/pushy/apns/RejectedNotificationListener.html). Rejected notification listeners are informed whenever APNs rejects a push notification. Here's an example of registering a simple listener:

```java
public class MyRejectedNotificationListener implements RejectedNotificationListener<SimpleApnsPushNotification> {

    public void handleRejectedNotification(SimpleApnsPushNotification notification, RejectedNotificationReason reason) {
        System.out.format("%s was rejected with rejection reason %s\n", notification, reason);
    }

}

// ...

pushManager.registerRejectedNotificationListener(new MyRejectedNotificationListener());
```

Lots of things can go wrong when sending notifications, but rejected notification listeners are only informed when Apple definitively rejects a push notification. All other IO problems are treated as temporary issues, and Pushy will automatically re-transmit notifications affected by IO problems later.

## The feedback service

Apple also provides a "feedback service" as part of APNs. The feedback service reports which tokens are no longer valid because the end user uninstalled the receiving app. Apple requires push notification providers to poll for expired tokens on a daily basis. See ["The Feedback Service"](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/CommunicatingWIthAPS.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH101-SW3) for additional details from Apple.

To get expired device tokens with Pushy:

```java
for (final ExpiredToken expiredToken : pushManager.getExpiredTokens()) {
    // Stop sending push notifications to each expired token if the expiration
    // time is after the last time the app registered that token.
}
```

## License and status

Pushy is available to the public under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

The current version of Pushy is 0.1.1. We consider it to be fully functional (and use it in production!), but the public API may change significantly before a 1.0 release.
